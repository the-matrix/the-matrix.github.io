  desc: "A bitter gourd favoured for its blood cleansing properties. These sometimes appear in the supermarket but you are more likely to get them in your local Indian foodstore. They have the appearance of a severely deformed knobbly bright green cucumber, in size between 3 and 7 inches in length. To prepare, scrape off all the green knobbly skin down to white flesh. Then cut in half across the vegetable's width Scoop out all the pips and pith inside to leave the flesh of the gourd casing. Cut this into thin rounds rather as you might with squid. Cover the karela hoops with plenty of salt and leave overnight. The salt helps to remove some of the bitterness. The next day, wash in plenty of cold water. You can salt the vegetable for much less time if you wish and this is purely up to your own taste buds. When I cook karela I only salt them for a couple of hours. Cook as instructed. Karala are an aquired taste, but they are quite delicious in my view"

Shake out the coconut juice into a cup and drink it yourself or give it to a child. Break the shell by dropping the nut onto a concrete surface. After breaking open the shell, the coconut meat can be prised away. The juice is not coconut milk. Dried coconut is known as Copra in Hindi and Coconut oil is Naryal ka tel"

  desc: "To make 450 ml, (3 pint). Empty 225 g (8 oz) unsweetened desiccated coconut into a food processor or blender. Pour over 450 Ml (3 pint) boiling hot water and process for 20-30 seconds. Turn into a large bowl and add an extra 150 ml (1 pint) hot water Leave to cool, then strain the coconut milk through a fine sieve (lined with muslin if possible), squeezing the coconut to extract the milk. Cover and store in the refrigerator; the coconut cream will quickly rise to the surface and can be skimmed off for separate use if required. You can use coconut powder to make coconut milk. You can buy it in Indian stores and some supermarkets. Always useful to have around. For the best coconut milk, grate a whole fresh nut (using a food processer). Add 250ml hot water and grind for a minute  Press the pulp through muslin into a bowl. Repeat twice more  This will give you about 800ml to 1litre of milk in varying consistencies"

  desc: "This is the quintessential Indian herb, the Italian Basil of the curry. Used throughout the continent for flavouring and garnishing. It has a beautiful aroma. To get the full effect, use towards the end of cooking. The little pots of coriander sold at the supermarket are frankly a waste of time and money. Some supermarkets are starting to sell bunches of the stuff just as they do in the Indian stores. Buy that, as most recipes call for a handful and the potted versions are lucky to contain a fingerful. It is quite difficult to grow in the UK as it tends to bolt very quickly. Some authors recommend parsley as an alternative. I would say, only in extremis and only for garnishing"

  desc: "These come in various shapes and sizes and are simply fresh chillies dried in the sun. Along with fresh chillies these form the most common heating agent in Indian food. They tend to be harsher and fierier than the fresh variety and thus impart a different type of heat flavour There are many from the bird or piri piri chillies which are tiny and very, very hot through to the Kashmiri which is used for its intense red colour rather than its heating properties. The Kashmiri (Deghi) is more likely to come from Karnataka than from Kashmir itself as the Kashmiris cannot produce enough for export. Other varieties include the Madras from Tamil Nadu, Guntar from Andhra Pradesh and Bedgi from Karnataka. Chillies (whether fresh or dried) can be deseeded if you want less fire."

  altname: "Hari Mirch"
  desc: "Originally imported into India, they gradually replaced pepper as the main heating agent\nin Indian food. Chillies are grown natively in India now. In the UK the source will be from all over the world, Kenya for the medium sized fat ones you will find in the supermarkets, South America and India for other varieties. As a general rule, the smaller they are, the hotter they will be. You can get all sorts at your local Indian supermarket/store. Red chillies are simply green chillies that have fully ripened. Dried chillies are those that have been dried in the sun. Chillies have their aficionados. To spice up a plate of omelet and chips I use the Greek style chillies pickled in brine as a condiment. Yum yum. Those pickled in vinegar tend to be more intense. For optimum devastation try the piri piri (South African,) a small red perfectly formed chilli most often found pickled in brine or vinegar. Beware, chillies ARE habit forming having some chemical in them that is mildly narcotic. If you like a mild chilli today, chances are you'll easily be able to take a much more fiery one in a couple of years. This poses a problem when entertaining as what tastes reasonable to you may well knock your guest for six. As a rule, cut down the amount of chilli in the main dishes and serve some knockout side raitas\nand accompaniments to keep you happy."

  desc: "Almost everyone knows about garlic these days. Often blamed years ago for odd smells, it\nhas now become so much a part of general English cooking that no one notices anymore. The sections of the bulb are known as cloves of garlic. Use as much as you feel comfortable with. To use, remove the skin from the clove, and chop or slice The finer you chop the stronger the flavour. Use a crusher for optimum strength. You can grow garlic in the garden very easily It's great planted amongst the roses as it is a greenfly deterrent. Like ginger, you can batch process it and freeze in ice cube trays. When frozen transfer the blocks to a freezer bag or box. When you defrost the garlic it may take on a greenish tinge. This is ok for cooking but you might use fresh cut for salads etc"

  desc: "A staple frying oil for Indian dishes, it is clarified butter. Ghee will heat to much higher temperatures than ordinary butter. To make your own Ghee, put 1/2 lb of unsalted butter into a bain marie and heat until oil separates from solids. Allow to cool slightly and pour off the oil into a sealable container, leaving the solids and water behind. Allow to solidify and store in fridge. It will keep several weeks. A vegetable ghee substitute is also available commercially which is a good substitute and will last in its container for many months without deterioration. Ghee is one of the essential flavours of restaurant food, with some establishments vying for a place in the record books for the amount of ghee they can put in a dish. If you wonder why this is, it is because most restaurants make their sauce bases in batches and ghee or oil is a good preservative. Hence by the time they have fried some spices and onions and added some base sauce, they will have a fair amount of oil in the dish. On health grounds you can use ordinary vegetable (or peanut) oil, but ghee (even the vegetable variety,) does add to the flavour of a dish. I would suggest that you use vegetable oil for ordinary use and make butter ghee for those special occasions"

If the skin is very thin, (ie ginger is fresh) just cut off the more obvious tough bits. Otherwise remove the skin of the root and then chop finely or slice depending on recipe. A good idea is to bung a whole load of ginger root into the food processor and chop it up. Then fill icecube trays with it and freeze. When frozen the cubes can be stored in the freezer in a freezer bag, giving you handy access to fresh ginger at any time"

The milk should separate into curds and whey, Allow to separate for a few minutes. Now drain out the whey via colander lined with muslin. You can throw the whey away or use it as a cooking stock. For making chhana, collect the four corners of the muslin and hang up the curds to drain thoroughly over night. For Paneer, squeeze the curds to release as much of the whey as possible. Wrap up the curds and put them on a board (chopping board), making a flat (about 1 inch or 25 cm) cake of them. Fill a large pan with water and place on top of the curds and leave for one hour. By this time the curds will have formed a solid mass of cheese. This can be cut into cubes and used in your recipe. It is now possible to buy Paneer in some supermarkets"

If you use frozen (cooked) ones, simply delay their introduction until the end of a recipe. Frozen prawns must be defrosted first and drained of the ice water. They then simply need warming through in the food. If you overcook them by even a little, they will shrink, become tough and waste the money you just laid out on them"

The savoury and sweet courses are all served together, it being up to the eater as to which order he mixes them with the rice. In southern India, the thali is usually vegetarian with more meat ones appearing as you move north. The thali or 'Meals' restaurants are the lowest order of restaurant in India, serving the working and travelling masses. Because they get through so much food, being incredibly cheap, you can usually be assured of a decent filling meal however as they work on an eat as much as you can basis. Thalis are designed to be eaten with the fingers (as is much of South Indian food,) and this perhaps explains their lack of profile in the UK"

  desc: "Use full fat organic yoghurt for flavour and texture. Do not use low fat stuff, its useless, having no flavour and totally inadequate for its job which is to act as a cooling agent, either as a side dish in a raita or in the sauce itself. Lassi is made from Buttermilk or Yoghurt and crushed ice with either salt or sugar added. Simply put ice into liqidizer, add yoghurt, salt or sugar and whiz. Perfect with a hot curry"
