This is a lightweight version of a very popular Indian desert, which can be very rich otherwise (and too rich for most western palates).  The unusual use of carrots may appear strange at first, but their natural sweetness is the reason why they appear in western deserts, the most obvious example that comes to mind being carrot cake!  This recipe is sufficient for 8 people and is often served with an icecream.
