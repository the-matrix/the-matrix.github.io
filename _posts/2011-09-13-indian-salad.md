This is a fairly common salad that I have seen in restaurants in India.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>Bunch White Radish (Mooli)</li><li>2 Red onions</li><li>2 firm red tomatoes</li><li>1/2 Crisp lettuce</li><li>6 Large fresh green chillies (see notes)</li><li>Juice of lime.</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Slice mooli into chunks</li><li>Cut onions into 1 inch/2.5 cm chunks</li><li>Quarter the tomatoes</li><li>De-seed the chillies by slitting into quarters, (do not separate from stem) and scooping out the seeds.</li><li>Chop lettuce into chunks</li><li>Place all in a bowl, add the lime juice, toss and serve</li></ol><p>Notes. You can get large fresh chillies (3 - 6 inches long) from your local Indian grocery. They are usually used for pickling and tend to be milder in heat. If you cannot find them use whatever you can get. If you are feeling really artistic, you can create chilli flowers by slitting each chilli into 8 strands, making sure that they stay intact on the stalk. Put the chilli into iced water where it should curl to form a floret. If you cannot get mooli, use ordinary radishes instead.</p>
