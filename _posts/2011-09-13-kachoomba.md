This is the classic Muslim accompaniment that is typically served (usually in a bastardized form,) with papadoms in Indian restaurants across Britain. If you want to be a little different for a starter simply spoon some of this onto a nice fresh papadom with a little salad: instant Papad Masala. Make this fresh each time you need it as it does not keep.
