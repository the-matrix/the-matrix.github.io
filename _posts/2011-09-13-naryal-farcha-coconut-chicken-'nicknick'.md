This recipe originally came to me from an old (and now sadly deceased,) friend, Nick Mortimer, and I have sort of adapted it over time to make it even simpler. This really is very easy. Nick used to have an annual garden party and this dish was a firm favourite for years.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>Whole chicken, skinned, washed and chopped into pieces</li><li>1 lg pot of natural yoghurt</li><li>2 green chillies, chopped fine</li><li>2 tblspn dessicated coconut</li><li>1 tspn ground cummin</li><li>1/2 tspn salt</li><li>1/2 tspn ground black pepper</li><li>Juice 1 lemon</p>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Score chicken pieces with a sharp knife</li><li>Mix all ingredients together in a non metallic bowl, making sure that chicken is totally covered.</li><li>Leave chicken to marinade in fridge for at least 3 hours and preferably overnight.</li><li>Barbecue or grill chicken pieces in the marinade. You can micro-wave the pieces for 3-5 minutes first if at all worried about undercooking but make sure that you replace any marinade onto chicken before placing on barbecue.</li></ol>
