This is a great dish to serve with a meat curry. Make your Paneer as instructed in the glossary but leave it under the weight for 2 hours to make it extra firm. This should serve 4 fat lads as an accompaniment.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>4 pint serving of Paneer</li><li>1lb (450g) of Chips.</li><li>1 tsp. mustard seed</li><li>8 curry leaves</li><li>4 green chillies, chopped</li><li>1 tbsp. tomato puree</li><li>2 tbsp. ghee.</li><li>Salt to taste.</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Prepare chips and get them frying. When the first fry has finished and  you are waiting for the oil to re-heat start with the rest of the recipe.</li><li>Cut Paneer into chip shapes.</li><li>Heat ghee in wok and add mustard seed. When it starts to crackle add  curry leaf and sizzle for 5 seconds then add chillies and salt and reduce heat.</li><li>Add Paneer and fry until golden. Gently turn the pieces so that they  colour evenly.</li><li>By now you should be able to return chips to oil to finish off. Do so  and remove the Paneer from the heat. Finish off the chips as instructed.</li><li>Return Paneer to heat and add tomato puree and stir to coat evenly. Add  chips and stir fry for a minute or two to mix the flavours.</li><li>Check seasoning and serve.</li></ol>
