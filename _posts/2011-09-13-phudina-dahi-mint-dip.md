This is a classic cooling yoghurt accompaniment when you've got something hot and spicy. Use fresh mint where possible.  Actually just a bowl of yoghurt seasoned with salt and sugar can be perfect foil to a hot curry like Pork Vindalho.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>Lg. handful fresh mint</li><li>1/2 Lg. pot plain thick yoghurt</li><li>1/2 tsp. salt</li><li>1/2 tsp. sugar</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Chop mint finely and mix all ingredients together</li><li>Allow dip to cool for at least 1 hour before use to give flavour time to develop</li></ol>
