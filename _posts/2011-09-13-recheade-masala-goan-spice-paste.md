Not really a sauce, but a preserve paste that is used as the basis for a lot of Goan dishes. This is a classic spice paste and can be used with seafood, white meat and pork. Store in a kilner jar (do not use a metal lidded jar) in the fridge indefinitely, ensuring that the paste always has a cover of oil to stop it drying out. If it does start to dry    out add a litle more vinegaran oil. Wipe the sides of the jar after taking out any masala.The recipe calls for a lot of chillis. The very best chillies you can use for this are the Kashmiri (mild and colourful) or Goan (hotter) variety. Please do try and track some down. This recipe will make about 0.3 litre depending on how much additional vinegar and oil you add to grind it
