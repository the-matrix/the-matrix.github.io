Sambhar is cooked in practically every home in southern India and can be found in almost every restaurant. It is often served for breakfast accompanied by Idlis (steamed rice cakes) and for lunch with Dosais (lentil pancakes) or rice. You can by ready made mixes (Gita brand) for idlis and dosais which although not as good as the real thing,are an awful lot easier. This is a vegetable curry and you can use almost any variety. Use a mixture of vegetables such as mooli, aubergines, onions, beans, potatoes, courgettes, carrots, turnips, cauliflower, okra and peppers.
