A Light teatime snack. Often called Bhajjis in UK Indian restaurants, Pakoras are very similar to them but the batter is made differently and uses ordinary wheat flour instead of Besan. Again, any filling can be used although as the batter is lighter, Pakoras are better with more subtle flavours such as grated cheese, prawns, chives and other herbs. As the resultant snack is smaller than a Bhajji, the filling ingredients should be chopped smaller.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>2 heaped tbsp. white flour</li><li>2oz (1 level tbsp.) butter</li><li>2 small eggs</li><li>1/2 cup of water</li><li>1/4 tsp. chilli powder (or to taste)</li><li>Salt to taste.</li><li>Oil for deep frying Bhajji</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Sieve flour, chilli powder and salt together</li><li>Boil butter and water together</li><li>Remove water from heat and add flour, beating all the time.</li><li>Return to heat and beat continuously until mixture leaves the side of vessel (you are  basically constructing a rue.)</li><li>Cool mixture. Beat eggs together and beat into cooled mixture slowly. Your mixture  should be soft and smooth.</li><li>Add filling mixture to batter and gently fold in.</li><li>Heat oil and drop a teaspoon of the batter mixture into the oil. Keep the Pakora  moving, add more as the oil reheats but do not overcrowd the pan.</li><li>Cook Pakoras until golden brown and serve immediately.</li></ol>
