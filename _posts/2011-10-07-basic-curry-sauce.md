This is a basic sauce that is used in a great many recipes. It is derived from the style of basic sauce often found in restaurants. These sauces usually have secret recipes known only to the head chef, but they do dictate, along with the stock, the fundamental taste of the restaurant. I present here only a starting point. You should adjust it according to your own tastes. Beware of making it too hot however, either with chillies or pepper. The principle is that it can be used to make a range of dishes. If those dishes require extra heat, then it can be added, but once in, cannot be taken away. I first saw this type of sauce described in one of Pat Chapman&#146;s books and I&#146;ve adapted it since to my own taste and style of cooking. When you&#146;ve finished cooking, allow it to cool, pack into 1/2 pint containers (yoghurt pots are handy for this,) and freeze. Defrost as needed.You will need a food blender, liquidiser , or a lot of elbow grease for this recipe. You will also require a large pan as this recipe will make up to 3 pints of sauce.
