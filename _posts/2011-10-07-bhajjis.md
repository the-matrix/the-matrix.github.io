Often confused with Pakoras, the Bhajji is a popular snack item across the continent and there are many varieties. The basic principle is a spiced Besan flour batter into which any variety of vegetable pieces are dropped and mixed to form a thick lumpy batter. Spoonfuls of the mix are then deep fried until dark golden. The resultant Bhajjis are then drained and served, properly with chutneys, but often in restaurants with a salad. An alternate method is to take thin slices of the vegetable and individually dip them in the batter and fry them. This works well with potatoes and large aubergine where you would use thin uncooked slices. Technically, Pakoras are made slightly differently but the result is similar.

<ul><li>1 cup Besan (gram) flour</li><li>1 tbsp. rice flour</li><li>1 tsp. chilli powder</li><li>1/2 tsp. turmeric</li><li>Pinch asafoetida</li><li>1/4 tsp.
