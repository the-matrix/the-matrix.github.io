Variations of this Anglo-Indian fish stew are ubiquitous all along the west coast of India, from Bombay down to Trivandrum.  It is a mild, delicate dish best served with plain rice although you might like to flavour the rice with a piece of aniseed, fennel or dill.  I like to use cod, but any firm fleshed white fish can be used. The sauce can be made ahead and the fish simply finished by reheating the sauce and continuing from step 5. This recipe serves 4 as a main course.
