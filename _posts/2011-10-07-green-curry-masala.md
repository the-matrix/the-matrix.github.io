This is another of those stock curry pastes from Pat Chapman (who in turn got it from Ivan Watson) that will keep indefinitely in the fridge (it has a permanent place in mine,) if prepared correctly. This is very distinctive mixing fresh coriander and mint to give a sharp herby flavour that can be used on its own with vegetables as in Green Vegetable Fry, mixed with yoghurt to form a marinade for chicken or added to any other curry to enhance flavours. The recipe will make enough for a 0.25 litre kilner jar.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>1 tsp. fenugreek seed, soaked  overnight in water.</li><li>6 cloves garlic, chopped</li><li>2 tbsp. chopped fresh ginger</li><li>3 tsp. sea salt</li><li>3 tsp. turmeric</li><li>2 tsp. chilli powder</li><li>8 cloves</li><li>10 green cardamoms</li><li>40g fresh coriander leaf</li><li>40g fresh mint leaf</li><li>120ml vinegar</li><li>50ml sesame oil</li><li>120ml vegetable oil</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Remove fenugreek seeds from water. They should have swollen and may acquire a jelly like coating. Grind all hard spices together until fine.</li><li>Puree all ingredients except vegetable oil (using a food processor for ease.)</li><li><p>Heat vegetable oil in wok and gently fry the puree for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently to stop it sticking to pan. Allow to cool for 3 or 4 minutes. If oil floats to top, it is done. If not add a little more oil and fry some    more. Be careful not to burn the garlic and ginger though.</li><li><p>Allow mixture to cool down a while and store in clean kilner jar. Put in fridge once totally cool. As you use it, make sure paste has a slight covering of oil before returning to fridge.</li></ol>
