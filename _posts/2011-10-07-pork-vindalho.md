There has been a serious amount of rubbish written about the Vindalho, so let us set some records straight.<br>1. The Vindaloo that you get in most high street curry houses has got as much to do with Indian cooking as fish and chips has.<br>2. Vindalho comes from Goa, India; not the Punjab Balti Hut, anywhere.<br>3. The stuff you get in restaurants is not Vindalho, (usually.)Vindalho (or Vindaloo, whichever,) is a word derived from language of Portuguese Goa, Vin for Vinegar, Alho for Garlic. The idea was to create a dish that could keep and so vinegar was used as a preserver. Vinegar also acts to intensify chilli heat,(anyone who has tried chillies pickled in vinegar will know what I mean.) The dish actually is better if cooked a day or 2 (max) before eating and kept in the fridge. This allows the meat to tenderise and for the flavour to become more rounded and full.I have tried a variety of vindalho recipes, some have used wine, some use a lot of vinegar, some require you to marinade the meat for days before hand, some throw in the chilli powder pot. Having tried this recipe, I hope you will agree that you need no other. The overall effect is hot, sour but also slightly sweet. I like this with plain rice and a fresh plain yoghurt.<strong><font color="#FF0000">Warning. This dish is chilli hot and is intended to be so</font>.</strong>The recipe is for 4 persons
