Tikkas are boneless meat pieces cooked in a Tandoor and usually served as a snack or starter course. Whilst chicken is undoubtedly the most common variety there is absolutely nothing to stop you making Tikkas with almost any meat including beef, venison,pork, lamb, goat or liver. The trick with all of them is to make sure you are using fresh lean meat of the best quality you can afford. Trim any fat off. Do not mix meat types in a single marinade. I have presented a few marinade versions below. Try them all and choose the one you like best.The basic method is to marinade your meat and then bake it. Cooking times depend on the type of meat and your preferences. Lamb, beef, venison and liver (needs less heat) can be cooked rare if liked whilst pork, chicken and goat need to be properly cooked. The quantities are for 1lb (450 g.) meat which should be enough for a small snack for 4-6 people.
