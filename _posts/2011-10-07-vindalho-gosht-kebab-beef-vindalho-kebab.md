For a full discourse on the Vindalho, see Pork Vindalho recipe. This variations uses red wine as its marinade base. I prefer wine to vinegar for this as I find the vinegar marinated versions too tart. This recipe is an adaptation that uses beef instead of the traditional pork. It uses a lot of chilli, but you can de-seed them if you wish. Although Vindalho is normally a stew, you&#146;ll find that beef marinated in this way and then grilled stays moist and appetising. <strong>This is hot.</strong>. You will need skewers for this.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>2lb (900g) Steak Beef, cut into 2 inch/5 cm cubes<br></li></ul><p><i>For the marinade.</i></p><ul><li>1 tspn salt</li><li>1/4 pint Red Wine</li><li>2 tblspn Red Wine Vinegar (Ordinary malt can be used.)</li><li>10 Dry red chillies</li><li>3 fresh green chillies</li><li>1 Red pepper (capsicum)</li><li>10 cloves</li><li>3 inch/7.5 cm cinnamon or cassia</li><li>1 tspn black pepper</li><li>5 cardomons</li><li>10 cloves garlic</li><li>1 inch/2.5cm piece of ginger</li><li>1 tblspn Paprika</li><li>1 tblspn Jaggery (or light brown sugar, white sugar as last resort.)</li><ol>
