This Tamil dish is hot, very hot. Quite brilliant just the same. In addition to a snack, it makes a great starter to a dinner party when it would be served on a bed of green leaves, red onion rings, tomatoes and sliced cooked beetroot, (very important as it has cooling properties.) It is quite possibly one of the hottest dishes I have come across, but it is very wonderful. The heat of the chillies is accentuated by the lemon juice to give a sharp, dry heat. If you cannot stand the heat, use a mild variety of chilli like Kashmiri with just a few hot ones
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>20 large hot dry red chillies, soaked in warm water</li><li>1 tspn cummin</li><li>1/2 tspn fennel</li><li>2 tbslpn coriander seed</li><li>3 - 4gr fresh ginger, peeled and pulped</li><li>Juice of 1 lemon</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>1lb boned, skinned chicken</li><li>Vegetable oil for deep frying.</li><li>Lemon wedges to garnish.</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Dry roast the cummin, fennel and coriander together and then grind with the drained chillies</li><li>Mix spice with ginger, lemon juice and salt in a bowl.</li><li>Chop chicken into bite size pieces</li><li>Add chicken to bowl and mix in marinade thoroughly.

You'll need at least 1 inch of oil in bottom of pan.</li><li>Fry chicken pieces (covered in marinade) a few at a time, do not overcrowd. Chicken should take only a few minutes to cook and will be dark golden brown on outside, white and    juicy on the inside.
