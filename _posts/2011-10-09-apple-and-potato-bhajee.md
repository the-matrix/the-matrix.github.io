I found this recipe from a book I bought at the <a href="http://cafespice.co.uk/" title="Cafe Spice - London" target="_blank">Cafe Spice</a> 
restaurant in London. The restaurant is one of my favourites and the book, 
'Cafe Spice Namaste' by <a href="http://cafespice.co.uk/watch-cyrus-in-action/youtube/" title="Cyrus talks" target="_blank">Cyrus Todiwala</a>, 
the restaurant's founding chef is worth looking out for interesting Nouvelle 
Indian dishes. This one is certainly different and very refreshing with a rich 
meat dish such as Champ Masala.
