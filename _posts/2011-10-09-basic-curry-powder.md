This is a basic curry powder that can be used by itself and as the basis for 
other masalas. It is not very hot (as in chilli hot) as you can always add more 
if needed.  <strong>Quantities are given in weight ratio.</strong> After the 
recipe, a total weight is given. This will give an indication of how much the 
recipe will make. All you have to do is work in ounces, grammes or whatever to 
make the mix.
