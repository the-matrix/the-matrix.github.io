Classic road-side snack that deserves space on the table; this is a recipe given to me by my good friend Shilpa Kotecha, a marvelous vegetarian cook. I had been to South India and came across these Wadas (or Bonda) in several places from roadside shacks to posh Tamil restaurants. So I described them to her and asked what they were. With a sly grin on her face she went home and produced this recipe the next day. In a slight variation of my own, I use a fork to mash the potatoes rather than a masher to produce a courser, lumpy texture to them. You can eat them hot or cold. Serve with a Alle Chutney, Ginger Chutney[/rcp], [rcp bbcb=1]Phudina Relish, Fresh Mint Relish[/rcp], [rcp bbcb=1]Fresh Coriander Relish, Dhania Patha Relish[/rcp], or simple Heinz tomato ketchup!Try them with a [rcp bbcb=1]Patia Sauce or if eating them hot as a main course in a vegetarian meal.These are an absolute favourite with my two younger boys to the extent that I can put almost anything else in front of them as long as there is Wada.  It's how I got them eating vegetarian food to ring the changes.
