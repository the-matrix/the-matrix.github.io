No, not the often unrecognisable concoction that is usually served up in your local high street curry house, but a lovely, dry potato dish, full of flavour and perfect to accompany a curry with a bit of sauce. This is also pretty good as a sandwich filler if allowed to go cold, or dip balls of potato in batter and deep fry for an alternative [rcp bbcb=1 rcpid=Batata+Wada]Bonda[/rcp]. If you like potatoes you can even try this with western food. Goes nicely with a meat stew or a bit of steak and kidney pudding. The recipe is good for 4 to 6 people depending on appetites.
