A stunning Lamb Chop dish that was good enough to win the author a prize from the BBC!This is a favourite of mine because I love eating without a knife and fork getting in the way, so anything on the bone is great. It is an adaptation of a karahi dish I have had on my travels.  Use the best quality lamb chops you can get on the bone. Remove the outer layer of fat and you will end up with lovely juicy chops in a stunning sauce. You can serve this as a simple meal with just hot breads (Naan, Roti etc) or make it a part of a larger meal with rice and other curries. Quantities are for 4 to 6 normal people if part of a larger meal or 2 fat boys for a snackette!
