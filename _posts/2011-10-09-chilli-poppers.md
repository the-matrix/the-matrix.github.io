These are great for chilli heads. Best made when you are also making Bhajjis[/rcp] or [rcp bbcb=1]Batata Wada as the same batter can be used. These are pure invention but are really fun. My friend Shilpa Kotecha makes a very similar dish but uses cream cheese for the filling. My version uses spiced potato. Its up to you, try both. To be completely bizarre, serve them as an accompaniment to Tequila Slammers.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>Fresh green plump (i.e. Kenyan) chillies of about 2 inches in length or greater. Try the large (6 inch+) salad chillies you can get in Asian foodstores.</li><li>Potato, cooked and mashed and seasoned with turmeric, salt and black pepper.</li><li>Batter. (See Bhajjis or Batata Wada)</li><li>Oil for deep frying.</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Wash and dry the chillies. Leave the stalks on.</li><li>Cut a slit down the side of the chilli and remove the seeds and any pith. Lightly score  the skin of the chilli to provide a key for the batter</li><li>Fill chilli with mashed potato.</li><li>Heat oil in wok to frying temperature.</li><li>Dip each chilli into the batter to coat thickly and drop into hot oil. Move around so that chilli is evenly cooked. You can add more chillies as the oil reheats but do not overcrowd. They are cooked when the batter is golden brown.</li><li>Remove chillies from oil when cooked and drain.</li><li>Serve with chutneys and fresh thick plain yoghurt.</li></ol>
