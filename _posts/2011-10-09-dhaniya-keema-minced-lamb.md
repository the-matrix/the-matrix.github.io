This Hyderabadi recipe for minced lamb is a typical Indian Muslim delicacy.  It can be served with rice, bread and side vegetables.  I like it on pasta as a change from bolognese sauce.  Use lean lamb mince and if you have a mincer at home, pass it through that to make a very fine mince (ground) meat. This will serve 4 to 6 people.
