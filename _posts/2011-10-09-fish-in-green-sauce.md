Not a Thai green sauce, but an Indian one. This is a great way to do fish but use a firm fleshed varieties like Monkfish. I have nicked this recipe from a book by Shehzad Husain and Rafi Fernandez called 'Best Ever Cooks Collection - Indian'</a>, published by Parragon. Rafi is a favourite author of mine and the book is excellent with interesting and imaginative recipes that really are Nouvelle Indian Cuisine. This recipe is typical and different. The quantities will serve 4 people.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>3 cloves of garlic</li><li>2 inch (5cm) piece of fresh ginger</li><li>1 large leek chopped roughly</li><li>6 green chillies</li><li>4 tbsp of mustard oil for preference or use vegetable oil</li><li>1/2 tspn fennel seed</li><li>1 tbsp ground coriander</li><li>1 tbsp crushed mustard seeds or mustard powder</li><li>6fl oz (175ml) thick coconut milk</li><li>8oz (225g) firm fish such as monkfish or huss cut into thick chunks</li><li>8oz (225g) fresh king prawns, peeled and cleaned but with tails left on</li><li>4oz (115g) fresh coriander chopped finely</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Grind up the garlic, ginger, leek and 4 of the chillies in a food processor. If you do not have a food processor but do have a liquidiser then use that and add the oil to assist the process.</li><li>Put ground paste into wok with the oil, heat and stir until well blended. If you use mustard oil, watch out that you do not burn the mixture as mustard    smoke will burn your eyes.</li><li>Add ground coriander, fennel seeds, mustard and coconut milk to pan and simmer gently for 5 minutes.</li><li>Add fish and simmer for 2 minutes.</li><li>Add prawns and cook until prawns are pink.</li><li>Season with salt and fold in fresh chopped coriander.</li><li>Serve hot garnished with the 2 remaining green chillies.</li></ol>
