Fish with Mustard SauceFish doesn't often make it onto the menu in Indian restaurants so you have to cook it at home. This Bengali recipe is one of my favourites, well anything in mustard is fine by me. Use a firm white fish such as Cod and serve simply with plain boiled rice and a Kachoomba. The sauce would also suit chicken or rabbit for a variation. This will serve 4 people.
