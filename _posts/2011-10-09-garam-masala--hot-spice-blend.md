The ubiquitous finishing spice mix. Most often used as a finishing spicing for a dish to give freshness and immediacy. This is only one variation. Others leave out the coriander, increase the cardamom or add Black cardamom. Masalas should be stored in dark airtight jars and as a rule improve with a bit of age.Quantities are given in weight ratio. After    the recipe, a total weight is given. This will give an indication of how much the recipe will make. All you have to do is work in ounces, grammes or whatever to make the mix.
