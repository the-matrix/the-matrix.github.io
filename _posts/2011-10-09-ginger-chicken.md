Another popular snack. Variations of this are found in many bars and small cafes across the sub continent. It uses boiled chicken. This comes about for two reasons. First, it means that cheaper, tougher birds can used and secondly it is easier to keep cooked chicken in a fast food place. In a variation of this recipe for garlic lovers, use 5 cloves of garlic and 1/2 inch of ginger to give a Garlic Chicken. Quantities are for 4 for a small snack.
