This is another of my own recipes using the Recheade Masala. Serve with a green salad and perhaps some crusty bread. The measures are a per person basis.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>1 Chicken breast.</li><li>1/2 tbsp Recheade Masala (Goan Spice Paste)</li><li>1/2 garlic clove, sliced thinly into flakes</li><li>6 cherry tomatoes, sliced in half</li><li>A little olive oil</li><li>1 tbsp chopped fresh oregano</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Score the chicken lightly and rub some masala into the meat with the back of a spoon. Leave at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours, (cover if flies or cats are a problem.)</li><li>Heat a little oil and gently fry the garlic flakes until golden but not burnt. Take garlic flakes and dry on kitchen paper.</li><li>Put chicken breasts into pan and arrange tomatoes around, cut side down.</li><li>Cook chicken gently until cooked, turning at least twice, but do not disturb the    tomatoes.</li><li>To serve, place chicken piece on plate and arrange tomatoes around.</li><li>Crush the fried garlic and sprinkle onto chicken.</li><li>Garnish with the chopped oregano.</li></ol>
