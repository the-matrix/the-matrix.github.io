Chickpeas form one of the most popular snack ingredients in India's vast snack army. Served by the roadside as cold snacks and in bars as warm snacks for beer, they are ubiquitous. They are also delicious, being firm and flavourful. This recipe is derivative of many and involves tomatoes, garlic and fennel. The final consistency should be dryish; you don't need masses of liquid.If you get any left over, pop them in the fridge. They'll keep a few days. Try them mashed in a sandwich or simply re-heat them and have them with a shepherds pie!
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>15oz tin of cooked chickpeas, drained and washed.</li><li>1 tblspn ghee or oil</li><li>1 tspn mustard seed</li><li>1 onion, chopped fine</li><li>4 cloves of garlic, chopped</li><li>1 tspn fennel</li><li>2 tblspn Basic Curry Powder mixed with water to form runny paste.</li><li>1 tblspn tomatoe puree</li><li>4 tomatoes, quartered</li><li>Salt and pepper</li><li>Lg pinch asafoetida (optional)</li><li>Hot water</li><li>Large handful of fresh chopped coriander</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Heat ghee and fry mustard till they begin to pop</li><li>Reduce heat, add onion, saute until translucent</li><li>Add garlic and fennel and saute for up to 5 mins, don't let garlic burn.</li><li>Reduce heat and add curry paste. Fry gently on low heat, constantly moving until water evaporates and paste darkens a little.</li><li>Add tomato puree, chickpeas and tomatoes with 1/4 pint hot water. Cook gently until water evaporates.</li><li>Add another 1/4 pint hot water and the salt, pepper and asafoetida. Cook gently until water has evaporated again leaving a dryish curry.</li><li>Stir in coriander and serve.</li></ol><p>Notes. You'll note that no chilli is involved in this recipe,(other than that which is in curry powder.) Not all curries are hot! However you can experiment and add some fresh green chopped chilli at the same time as the curry paste. If you like fresh curry leaves, you could try adding 10 chopped ones when you add the garlic and leave out the fennel. Lovely.</p>
