Kofta are meatballs. Typically they are made from ground meat and spices, grilled andthen braised in a rich creamy sauce.This is a sharp tangy sauce that I developed for barbecues where you want strong flavours. For a richer version try Kofta Sauce #2
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>1/2 Onion chopped very fine</li><li>2 cloves Garlic chopped fine</li><li>1 tblspn ghee</li><li>4 cloves</li><li>4 crushed green cardamon</li><li>1 tspn onion seed</li><li>1 1/2 tspn cummin seed</li><li>1 tblspn Basic Curry Powder mixed with water to form a thin paste, (make prior to starting)</li><li>6 fl oz good thick yoghurt</li><li>3 fl oz double cream</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Heat ghee, onions and garlic gently in a pan with a lid to &#145;sweat&#146; the onions, (about 5 minutes.) This process should make them translucent and soft without burning.</li><li>Add the 4 whole spices to pan and continue to sweat for another 5 minutes.</li><li>Add curry paste and stir gently for 3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent sticking. Add additional small amounts of water to assist in prevention of sticking if necessary. The idea is to cook the spices, not burn them.</li><li>Allow mixture to cool for 10 minutes.</li><li>Add the yoghurt and heat gently. Keep cooking until the yoghurt separates and then cook a while longer, about 10 minutes. Do not allow to stick.</li><li>Allow to cool until needed. You can at this point (when cooled a little,) liquidise the sauce to create a smooth version, or leave it with texture. If you don&#146;t have a liquidiser, push the sauce through a sieve.</li><li>When ready to serve, add salt and pepper to taste and add the cream. Heat the sauce  gently for 5 minutes and serve.</li></ol>
