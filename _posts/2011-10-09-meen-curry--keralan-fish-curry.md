Fry for a further 2 minutes.</li><li>Add potatoes and fry until lightly golden.</li><li>Add thinnest of coconut milk, cover and simmer until potato almost done. Make sure that pan does not dry out by adding a splash of water if necessary.</li><li>Add medium thick coconut milk and your fish. Simmer uncovered until fish is cooked.</li><li>Add thickest coconut milk and simmer for a minute.</li><li>Consistency should be a little runny, plenty of sauce. If too thick add a little water and heat through. Add vinegar and coriander, mix and serve.</li></ol>
