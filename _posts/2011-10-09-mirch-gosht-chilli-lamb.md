A hot, sweet and sour barbecue flavour lamb dish owing much of its flavour to the use of soy sauce. This is traditionally thought of as a Chinese ingredient, and so it is, but the huge trade between the Indian subcontinent and China over the years has led to a cross fertilisation of ideas and food ingredients. Soy is quite popular in daily home cooking as a result. Again quantities are barbecue sized.You will need skewers for this recipe
