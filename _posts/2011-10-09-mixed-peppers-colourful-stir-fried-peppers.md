Another of my own recipes that draws on the typical Keralan style to create a colourful mix of the Mediterranean and India. This is quite simple and can be used as an accompanying vegetable for a larger feast. How long you cook the peppers is entirely up to you. I like mine just on the hard side, some prefer them soft. The longer you cook sweet peppers (capsicum) however, the sweeter they will be. This will serve 3 or 4 people as a side dish or 2 as a main dish.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>3 small sweet peppers in red, yellow and green, de-cored and chopped roughly</li><li>1 small onion, sliced</li><li>1 tsp. mustard seed</li><li>10 curry leaves, chopped roughly</li><li>3 green chillies, chopped.</li><li>1 tsp. cummin seed.</li><li>1 tbsp. ghee or oil.</li><li>1/2 cup of water.</li><li>Salt to taste</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Add mustard seed and curry leaves. Fry until the mustard just starts to  crackle</li><li>Fry onion 'til light golden, medium heat</li><li>Add cummin seed and fry on for another 30 seconds</li><li>Add chillies and peppers, fry on for 2 minutes at high heat, stirring constantly.</li><li>Add water and salt, bring to boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer. Stir occasionally  until peppers are to your liking.</li></ol>
