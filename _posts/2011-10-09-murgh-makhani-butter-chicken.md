Butter chicken is a restaurant classic, originating in Delhi. It is based on using up the remains of the tandoori marinade. This recipe is a domesticated version and is stunning. Serve simply with nan breads. For 4 people.  I have made this for 80 people at a time, and in which case you need to reduce the amount of chillies and liquid to retain the shape of the dish.

<ul><li>1kg chicken on or off bone as preferred. Cut chicken into manageable chunks.</li></ul><p><em>Marinade</em></p>  <ul><li>2 cups good quality yoghurt</li><li>6 cloves garlic, chopped.</li><li>1/2 inch fresh, chopped.</li><li>1 tsp mild red chilli powder (kashmiri)</li><li>1/4 tsp coriander powder</li><li>1/2 tsp cummin powder</li><li>1/2 tsp Garam Masala - Hot Spice blend</li><li>pinch tandoori food colour</li><li>1/2 lime juice</li></ul><p><em>Makhani Sauce</em></p><ul><li>700g tomatoes</li><li>1/2 tsp ground dried fenugreek leaf</li><li>75g chilled butter</li><li>1/2 tsp red chilli powder</li><li>1 tsp ginger/garlic puree</li><li>1/4 tsp garam masala</li><li>salt to taste.
