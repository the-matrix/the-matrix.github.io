This is the Indian version of the Chinese sweet and sour sauce, but as you will see is not as sickly as the Chinese version. The balance of sweet, sour and heat is maintained to give a well rounded sauce. Although the recipe appears to use a lot of chilli, you&#146;ll find that it is well balanced by the tamarind and sugar.Traditionally served with Prawns,you could also try it with chicken that has been cooked first, or paneer. The quantities below will give you 4 portions that are good for 2-3 people with 250gr of prawns. The prawns are not meant to be swimming in sauce, merely generously coated. If your prawns are uncooked, they can be cooked in the sauce by adding a little extra water and simmering until reduced and prawns cooked. If using frozen prawns, defrost them and simply warm them and the sauce together before serving. Sprinkle the dish with chopped coriander when putting on the table.
