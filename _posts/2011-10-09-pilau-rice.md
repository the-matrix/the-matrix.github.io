There are many recipes for Pilau (or Pilaf) but the basic method is that you cook rice and other ingredients together. This simple recipe is just a starter for a basic Pilau but you could expand it by adding sultanas, almonds, cashew nuts, cooked chicken or lamb, peas, mushrooms or in other words just about anything. The colour in this recipe comes from turmeric but could come from saffron.Cooking rice is often a problem for people who do not cook a lot of it.There are two main methods, absorption where the rice is cooked gently and absorbs the water and retains all of its starch. We use this method for Pilau. The other method where you use a lot of water and drain it off and wash the rice with hot then cold water is best used for preparing rice for frying as it loses most of the starch (and much of the goodness). I read a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deliaonline.com/how-to-cook/rice-and-pasta/how-to-cook-perfect-rice.html">DeliaSmith</a> article recently and she recommends using as a wide a pan as you can for cooking rice. I tried it and it worked well. She also says you do not need to wash and soak rice for plain boiled rice which I do not agree with, which just proves that cooking is an individual thing.Pilau requires Basmati or better rice, so do not stint on this. For portions I use my hand, two handfuls of dry rice per person. This gives about half a cup or about 3oz (85g) per person. It is not an exact science. The amount of water you use is based on the dry weight of the rice. Use 1 litre per 450g, 1.75 pints (or 4 cups) per 1lb. Scale up or down as required. The recipe below is for 1lb (450g) rice which will serve 4 to 6 people.
