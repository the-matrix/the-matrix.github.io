This is a classic Goan recipe that uses the very versatile Recheade Masala (Goan Spice Paste). This is a chutney that can be served as an accompaniment to other dishes or as a starter if warmed slightly and served with some good crusty bread. Try it also as a stuffing for a samosa. My mate Nick devised a great starter with it which simply involves wrapping a spoonful into 1/2 a sheet of filo pastry, brushing lightly with oil and baking in the oven. Serve with thick yoghurt or creme fresh sprinkled with a touch of paprika.You will need a kilner or other form of tight lidded storage jar for this. Make sure it is clean. Balchao can be kept in the fridge for quite a while depending on the size of prawns. Small prawns will keep longer as they have less moisture in them. Large prawns will be allright for 1 or 2 weeks. Use smaller prawns for preference.
