This is an invention of my own that draws on experience of Goan style cuisine. The basis for the spice mix is the Recheade Masala (Goan Spice Paste) but using lime instead of vinegar and made fresh. I hope you will like them. Serve 2 per person for a starter or as part of a larger meal. The recipe is for 4 people and despite the appearance of having many steps in the method can be accomplished quite quickly.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>8 baby squids, cleaned and cuttle removed. Reserve the tentacles.</li><li>50g small frozen cooked prawns, defrosted and drained of water.</li><li>2 large dried Kashmiri red chillies, broken</li><li>10g fresh ginger root, chopped fine</li><li>3 garlic cloves, chopped fine</li><li>1 tsp. coriander seeds</li><li>1/2 tsp. cumin seeds</li><li>1/2 inch, 1 cm piece of cinnamon</li><li>1 peppercorn</li><li>Juice of 1 lime</li><li>Olive Oil</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>8 cocktail sticks</li><li>2 tomatoes, sliced to garnish</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Grind dry spices together to a medium fine powder.</li><li>Add garlic and ginger and grind to a paste.</li><li>Add lime juice to paste, stir and set aside for 1/2 hour.</li><li>Heat 2 tbsp. of oil and add spice paste. Fry gently for 10 minutes until paste and oil separate. If it looks like drying out and burning, add small amounts of water to avoid it. Do not let the paste burn.</li><li>Add prawns, raise heat, mix and cook prawns to release some moisture, about 3 minutes. Do not allow to stick. Remove from the pan and set a side in a bowl. Retain the frying pan.</li><li>Mash the prawn mixture with a fork to break it up.</li><li>Chop the squid tentacles into small pieces. (Discard beaks if you find them.)</li><li>Heat pan again and throw in chopped tentacles and salt to taste. Stir fry quickly for 30 seconds and no more.</li><li>Add tentacles to prawn mixture and stir.</li><li>Stuff each squid with the mixture dividing it equally amongst the squid. It is honestly easier to use your fingers for this rather than trying to use a spoon. Secure each squid with a cocktail stick stitched across the open end.</li><li>Arrange slices of tomato on each plate</li><li>Rinse your frying pan, dry and return to heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil.</li><li>Quickly fry the squid on a medium heat, turning frequently (use tongs if you have them). The cooking should not take more than 2 minutes otherwise the squid will become tough.</li><li>Place 2 squid on each plate and serve immediately. If as a starter, crusty bread is an ideal accompaniment.</li></ol>
