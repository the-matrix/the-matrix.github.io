My ex-wife's favourite vegetable dish, this is an excellent accompaniment to just about any Indian meat curry or serve it with rice for a simple vegetarian meal. Although originally done without the gooseberries, we struck on this combination one day when I couldn't get enough tindora but had some gooseberries! Bizarre yes, but effective. This serves four as a side dish.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>1lb Tindora</li><li>6oz fresh firm gooseberries</li><li>2 inch piece of ginger, chopped</li><li>garlic, chopped</li><li>4 green chillies, chopped</li><li>2 tsp. tomato puree</li><li>1/2 tsp. turmeric</li><li>1 tsp. chilli powder</li><li>1 tsp. Garam Masala - Hot Spice blend</li><li>4 tsp. soy sauce</li><li>1/2 tsp. cummin seed</li><li>1/2 tsp. mustard seed</li><li>Lg. pinch asafoetida</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>2 tbsp. oil</li><li>Firm tomato chopped fine</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Wash, top and tail Tindora and Gooseberries. Cut Tindora in half  lengthways.</li><li>Liquidise the garlic, ginger, chillies, tomato puree, chilli powder, turmeric, garam  masala and soy sauce in 1/2 cup of water.</li><li>Heat oil in wok, add mustard seed and allow to crackle then add asafoetida and cumin seed and fry for a few seconds.</li><li>Add tindora and contents of liquidiser and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li><li>Add a cup of water and bring to boil.</li><li>Add gooseberries and salt, cover and simmer until Tindora cooked, about 10 minutes. You  can cook for longer if you prefer softer Tindora but be careful that you do not obliterate the gooseberries which should remain intact if possible.</li><li>Garnish with chopped tomato.</p>
