Nothing like a succulent prawn, lightly spiced and tangy. For this recipe use the biggest and best fresh prawns you can get. Yes I know they are expensive but there are some things in life you just have to buy. Get them with their shells still on or at least with their tails on. If fully clothed then remove all but the tail piece to give you something to hang on to (the prawn, not you.) The recipe is for 12 large prawns. Somewhere I read that it was supposed to serve 4 people. They must be having a laugh, 12 large prawns is enough for one and do not let anyone tell you otherwise! When I was in Southern Goa some years ago I was offered 6 large prawns for my evening meal in the beach bar we were staying at. Fresh in that day, they were superb. Thing is though, in that part of India, 6 prawns weigh in at 1 kilo. Had some the next night too!
