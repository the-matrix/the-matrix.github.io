A recipe derived from a traditional Muslim festive dish.
This recipe is a derivation of a traditional Muslim chicken dish that I have had around for years. It is an excellent way to cook a whole bird and can be served with more the traditional English accompaniments such as roast potatoes etc. It is a complex recipe requiring three stages of preparation. The result is worthwhile giving a succulent dish that can be eaten hot or cold. This recipe is for 4 people and is based on 3.5lb (1.5kg) of meat. You can use a turkey breast or a whole bird. It's just as good with chicken. Scale the recipe up or down as required. You will need a casserole big enough to take the whole piece of meat so that may limit the size you can manage. As you will see, it's quite a physical recipe so a long cold drink to refresh you after step 10 is required.
