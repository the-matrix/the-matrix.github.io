This is a straightforward meat and potato stew from Kerala, and I found it in what to me is one of the best Indian food books, 50 Great Curries of India</a> by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007pr/25/foodanddrink.restaurants" target="_blank" title="Read about Camellia here" class="bbcbrecipeextlink">Camellia Panjabi</a>. For me this is an excellent standby meal because it is so easy to cook, requiring only that you have a tin of coconut milk in reserve in the cupboard and a chicken in the freezer. If you halve the amount of black pepper and reduce the chillies by deseeding you may find that children will eat this as well.
        
## Ingredients
        
<ul><li>12 new potatoes, par boiled with salt and 1/2 tsp. turmeric</li><li>3lb chicken, skinned and chopped into pieces. You can also de-bone it if you wish</li><li>1 inch piece of Fresh Ginger, chopped.</li><li>2 medium Onions, grated or chopped very fine</li><li>2 green chillies chopped</li><li>1 tsp. Black peppercorns</li><li>1/2 tsp. turmeric</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>3 tbsp. Oil</li><li>1/2 tsp. Mustard Seed</li><li>1 Bay leaf</li><li>2 cloves garlic, chopped.</li><li>2 inch Cinnamon or Cassia</li><li>6 green cardamom split</li><li>3 cloves</li><li>20 curry leaves</li><li>1 carrot, chopped</li><li>2 cups fresh or canned coconut milk.</li><li>1/2 cup frozen or fresh peas</li><li>1/4 tsp. Garam Masala - Hot Spice blend powder.</li></ul>
        
## Method

<ol><li>Put ginger, peppercorns and turmeric into mortar and pound into rough  paste</li><li>Heat oil and add mustard seed. When it starts to crackle add bay leaf. When that turns  khaki add garlic, cinnamon and cardamoms.</li><li>After 20 seconds add paste, cloves and curry leaves. After further 20 seconds add the  onion and chillies and cook through, stirring regularly until onion turns translucent.</li><li>Add chicken pieces and cook for 5 minutes over gentle heat.</li><li>Add potatoes, carrots and salt and cook for 2 minutes.</li><li>Add coconut milk, 1/2 cup of water and peas. Cover and cook until potato and chicken  done. This stew should have a thinnish gravy so if it is getting too thick add more  coconut milk or water.</li><li>Add garam masala and heat for 2 minutes.</li><li>Serve in a bowl with warmed Nan bread.</li></ol>
